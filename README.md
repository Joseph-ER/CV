Hi, I'm Joseph! Currently studying on the Makers Academy course. I absolutely love that my new life is problem solving through code!
#A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.

- Any experience relevent to software development

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### Excellent time management

Having worked in theatre for the past year, I am very used to working with and managing time pressures. I am used to managing expectations and scope of projects in the rehearsal/development phase, as well as setting up and dealing with last minute issues close to a performance time/deadline.

- I successfully developed, designed and performed an expanded scope performance of my final University year's performance in a Fringe theatre feestival. To do this, I took on rolesof deisnging the lighting, sound and video for the performance, performing and operating sound and video in the final piece as well as teaching someone how to operate the lighting for the performance. This meant that the scope of any technical aspects of the performance were my responsibility. This meant I taught myself any software and hardware I was not familiar with, such as lighting desk Jester, as well as limiting the scope of the performance so that we did not promise more than we could deliver. This meant holding off on technological aspects such as an interactive video call projection as it brought on more complications too soon to the first performance to be ironed out completely, as well as adding additional elements where possible in orderto enhance the show. One example being a full video projection of the live action on stage.


#### Stressful situations

Working in theatre I have become used to ignoring stress in orderto fix the issue as quickly as possible, without breaking the show and world for the audience or causing issues for any ofthe other tech staff or performers.

- One morning on the set of "Doctor Who: Time Fracture" as acting Head of Sound, after turning on the equipment throughout the site, an error arose. The issue was that a communication had not been established between all the different speakers and projectors throughout the building.
- Firstly I assessed the errors occuring to make sense of the issue, and after a I had tested a few ideas to fix the problems it was getting too close to the start of the performance, so I made the desicion I needed to inform higher members of staff to get a solution and to inform them the show may be affected.
- I alerted the Stage Manager so she could prepare explanations for audience and fellow staff if necessary. I then contacted the Production Sound Installer, informed him of the issue and what how I had attempted to solve the issue.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

What was the skill?
- Situation
- how was it used?
- action?
- result

## Education

#### Makers Academy (May 2022 to September 2022)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)

#### Black Belt in Karate!

Although this doesn't help me in coding as I can't roundhouse kick theerror messages away, it does show my commitment, dedication and respect. I loved being involved in my Karate club and respect was one of the main pillars of the Martial Art which has stuck with me ever since.

## Hobbies

I love geeking out about games, technology! I love to hear other people's excitement about the world of gaming and technology and share my own interests! I also enjoy relaxing by playing guitar and have reently started painting and playing with Warhammer 40,000 miniatures!
