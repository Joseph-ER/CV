## Joseph Edwards Rean 🎮🖌
Hi, I'm Joe! A new Software Developer from the Makers Academy Bootcamp. I love that my new life is problem-solving through code!
What I love about tech is how flexible it is; for every single problem I've come across I've found multiple different ways to solve the issue in varying complexities!

## Skills

### React Native- 2 Week project ⏳
- For the final 2-week project at Makers Academy, me and my team decided to learn React Native from scratch
- We used React Native for the front end of our application so we could create a great-looking app on IOS and Android
- I had no prior experience with React or React Native, so this was quite a challenge! It was a lot more work to learn, as the syntax was different from CSS and HTML, so I found the initial learning curve of the new technology difficult
- To combat the difficulties, I dived deep into researching and understanding React and React Native limitations and good practice, React Native syntax as well as looking at code of existing projects to get a better understanding of how the code affects the visuals/functionality of the app, following guides from their website and reading the developer documentation for React Native
- The hardest part for me was transferring data from the back end (web scraper API and HTML parsing functions) into the front end in a way that was displayed appropriately. I found this hard, as it was quite different from how this would be achieved in HTML.
- After lots of hard work, the result is a nicely functioning and good-looking app prototype that was responsive, clear, and concise! I'm proud of it for a 2-week project!

#### Excellent time management ⌚

Having worked in theatre for the past year, I am very used to working with and managing time pressures. I am used to managing expectations and the scope of projects in the rehearsal/development phase, as well as setting up and dealing with last-minute issues close to a performance time/deadline.

- I successfully developed, designed, and performed an expanded scope performance of my final University year's performance in a Fringe theatre festival.
- To do this, I took on roles of designing the lighting, sound, and video for the performance, performing and operating sound and video in the final piece as well as teaching someone how to operate the lighting for the performance.
- This meant that the scope of any technical aspects of the performance was my responsibility. This meant I taught myself any software and hardware I was not familiar with, such as lighting desk Jester, as well as limiting the scope of the performance so that we did not promise more than we could deliver.
- This meant holding off on technological aspects such as an interactive video call projection as it brought on more complications too soon to the first performance to be ironed out completely, as well as adding additional elements where possible to enhance the show. One example is a full video projection of the live action on stage.


#### Working Well Under Pressure 😎

Working in theatre I have become used to ignoring stress to fix the issue as quickly as possible, without breaking the show and world for the audience or causing issues for any of the other tech staff or performers.

- One morning on the set of "Doctor Who: Time Fracture" as acting Head of Sound, after turning on the equipment throughout the site, an error arose. The issue was that communication had not been established between all the different speakers and projectors throughout the building.
- Firstly I assessed the errors occurring to make sense of the issue, and after I had tested a few ideas to fix the problems it was getting too close to the start of the performance, so I made the decision I needed to inform higher members of staff to get a solution and to inform them the show may be affected.
- I alerted the Stage Manager so she could prepare explanations for the audience and fellow staff if necessary. I then contacted the Production Sound Installer and informed him of the issue and how I had attempted to solve the issue.


## Education 🏫

#### Makers Academy (May 2022 to September 2022) 🎓

- Learnt solid Test Driven Development principles in both Ruby and Javascript with RSpec and Jest respectively
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD- Utilised mainly our final project Ratify
- Improved my self-lead learning, especially in the final project (React Native 2 week section above)
- Build excellent teamworking foundations using Agile workplace practices including sprints, standups, and retros
- Introduction to Async, which I have further explored in Ratify, my final project
- Web dev weeks covered HTML, HBS, and CSS for the front end design of projects
- Learnt database basics PostgreSQL and MongoDB for NoSQL
- 3 different time constrained team working projects
- Learnt basics of Express set up and principles of full-stack development

#### Goldsmiths University of London (September 2018 to July 2021) 🎭

- BA Drama and Theatre Arts 
- 1st Class Honours
- I was an active member of the Drama Society during my time at Goldsmiths, where I had a great time performing for 2 consecutive years in the Drunk Shakespeare productions of 'Rumeo and Giniet' and 'MacBev'd'

#### Black Belt in Karate! 🥋

Although this doesn't help me in coding as I can't roundhouse kick the error messages away, it does show my commitment, dedication, and respect. I loved being involved in my Karate club and respect was one of the main pillars of Martial Art which has stuck with me ever since.

## Hobbies 🎮🖌

I love geeking out about games, and technology! I love to hear other people's excitement about the world of gaming and technology and share my interests! I also enjoy relaxing by playing guitar and have recently started painting and playing with Warhammer 40,000 miniatures!

I also currently own 4 pet rats! 🐀🐀🐀🐀
